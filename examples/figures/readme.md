### R-scripts for plotting figures
These scripts can be executed in this same folder as follows:
> Rscript "scriptname"

This will produce corresponding output plots, whereas these scripts are already incorporated into pipeline and will produce these plots and save into results folder after completion of pipeline. These scripts will use input files already placed in examples folder which is one folder up to this directory.
